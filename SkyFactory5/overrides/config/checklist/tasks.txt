# Welcome to SkyFactory® 5
#§1============================
#You probably noticed there's no color! Don't worry, your computer isn't broken. Each of the 16 Minecraft Colors will have to be discovered in a variety of ways: Crafting, in-world actions, etc. If you get stuck, the Advancements should help you out.

# How to Use This Book
#Use the arrows at the bottom of the pages to navigate. You will see challenges separated into ages that represent the general path of progression, although you do not need to do them in order. Simply check the box next to each challenge on completion. Careful though, tasks become increasingly difficult as you progress! Also, don't forget to craft yourself a Task Table to store this book!

#§1--==§ Mob Spawning§1==--

#Mobs do not spawn initially and require you to complete Gateways to obtain Trophies, these can be placed and activated to allow that mob to spawn around the player.

#Mobs will spawn on most normal blocks and don't require specific blocks like grass or water. You do not need to worry about Biomes, Dimensions, etc, only light level and distance requirements matter.

#Light levels matter when spawning mobs, §2Passives from 8 to 15§0 while §4Hostiles require light levels 0 to 7§0 You can easily find the light level by pressing §3§lF7

#Mobs only spawn §5> 24 blocks away from the player

#Additionally, Mobs will spawn from Spawners found in the world. They can be mined, without Silk Touch, and upgraded. Using a Trophy on them will change which mobs spawn.
